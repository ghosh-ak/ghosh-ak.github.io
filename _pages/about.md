<br> I'm currently an Assistant Professor at [Kitami Institute of Technology](https://www.kitami-it.ac.jp/), Japan. <br> As a researcher, I am passionate about advancing the field of smart manufacturing / Industry 4.0.

My current research focuses on developing intelligent manufacturing systems and related issues:
 * Digital Twins
 * Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
 * Time Latency in Signal Processing
 * Semantic Annotation and Data Representation
 * Data Inequality
 * Digital Manufacturing Commons 
<br> and beyond ...

Apart from this, I enjoy reading and traveling, and I have a love for music and football!
