I'm currently an Assistant Professor at [Kitami Institute of Technology](https://www.kitami-it.ac.jp/), Japan.

As a researcher, I am passionate about advancing the field of smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0.

My current research focuses on developing intelligent manufacturing systems and related issues:
- Digital Twins
- Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
- Time Latency in Signal Processing
- Semantic Annotation and Data Representation
- Data Inequality
- Digital Manufacturing Commons

Apart from this, I enjoy reading and traveling, and I have a love for music and football!
