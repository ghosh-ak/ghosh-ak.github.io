I'm currently an Assistant Professor @ [Kitami Institute of Technology](https://www.kitami-it.ac.jp/), Japan.

As a researcher, I am passionate about advancing the field of smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0. 

My current research focuses on developing intelligent manufacturing systems and related issues:
Digital Twins, 
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), 
Time Latency in Signal Processing, 
Semantic Annotation and Data Representation,
Data Inequality, and 
Digital Manufacturing Commons.

Apart from this, I like to read and travel, love music and football!

Welcome to my digital realm and feel free to explore!
