* <b> Big Data Inequality and Digital Manufacturing Commons </b>
    <br><br> Big data analytics, an essential constituent of smart manufacturing, fuels decision-making by extracting knowledge underlying big data. However, developing manufacturing big data and relevant analytics has challenges, such as mitigating big data inequality, mitigating black box syndrome, and ingesting externally generated data. Fulfilling these challenges is essential for supporting SMEs, making the systems feasible for real-life manufacturing practices, avoiding biases while analyzing the BD, and promoting innovation. Our [research team @ KIT](https://kit-amel.jp/) is working on these issues based on the concept of digital manufacturing commons (DMC) to construct widely accessible manufacturing big data and relevant analytics. We are also researching for a less resource-dependent, computationally light, transparent, and more human-engaging systems architecture.

* <b> Sensor Signal-based Digital Twins </b>
    <br><br> Digital twins (Object, Process, and Phenomenon twins) are needed for virtualizing a real-life manufacturing process and functionalizing high-level cognitive tasks (monitoring, understanding, predicting, decision-making, and adapting). Our [research team @ KIT](https://kit-amel.jp/) is working on developing phenomena twins, using historic phenomena-relevant sensor signal datasets (e.g., cutting force, cutting torque, and alike). Two computerized systems: Digital Twin Construction System (DTCS) and Digital Twin Adaptation System (DTAS), are developed for constructing and adapting the twins, respectfully. The DTCS acquires the relevant datasets from cloud, machine learns the knowledge underlying the datasets, simulates the relevant phenomenon, and validates the simulation outcomes. On the other hand, the DTAS adapts the validated outcomes for real-time monitoring.

* <b> Semantic Annotation and Data Representation </b>
    <br><br> In smart manufacturing, manufacturing enablers (machine tools, monitoring systems, digital twins, and alike) and human resources need knowledge for performing high-level cognitive tasks (monitoring, understanding, predicting, decision-making, and adapting). The ever-growing knowledge-bases in the human-cyber-physical systems supply the required knowledge. The knowledge in the knowledge-bases must be human/machine-comprehensible, represented by a scalable ontology-based representation method. In reality, representation methods are mostly domain-specific and follow strict ontological formalism. Our [research team @ KIT](https://kit-amel.jp/) is addresseing this issue by proposing a semantic annotation-based representation method. The annotation mechanism follows knowledge-type-aware concept mapping. A computerized system, denoted as Semantically Annotated Data Visualization System (SAD-VS), is also developed for human/machine comprehensibility of the represented knowledge.
