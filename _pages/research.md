* <b> Big Data Inequality and Digital Manufacturing Commons </b>
    <br><br> Big data analytics, an essential constituent of smart manufacturing, fuels decision-making by extracting knowledge underlying big data. However, developing manufacturing big data and relevant analytics has challenges, such as mitigating big data inequality, mitigating black box syndrome, and ingesting externally generated data. Fulfilling these challenges is essential for supporting SMEs, making the systems feasible for real-life manufacturing practices, avoiding biases while analyzing the BD, and promoting innovation. Our [research team @ KIT](https://kit-amel.jp/) is working on these issues based on the concept of digital manufacturing commons (DMC) to construct widely accessible manufacturing big data and relevant analytics. We are also researching for a less resource-dependent, computationally light, transparent, and more human-engaging systems architecture.

* <b> Sensor Signal-based Digital Twins </b>
    <br><br> Digital twins (Object, Process, and Phenomenon twins) are needed for virtualizing a real-life manufacturing process and functionalizing high-level cognitive tasks (monitoring, understanding, predicting, decision-making, and adapting). Our [research team @ KIT](https://kit-amel.jp/) is working on developing phenomena twins, using historic phenomena-relevant sensor signal datasets (e.g., cutting force, cutting torque, and alike). Two computerized systems: Digital Twin Construction System (DTCS) and Digital Twin Adaptation System (DTAS), are developed for constructing and adapting the twins, respectfully. The DTCS acquires the relevant datasets from cloud, machine learns the knowledge underlying the datasets, simulates the relevant phenomenon, and validates the simulation outcomes. On the other hand, the DTAS adapts the validated outcomes for real-time monitoring.

* <b> Semantic Annotation and Knowledge Representation </b>
    <br><br> In smart manufacturing, various manufacturing enablers, such as machine tools, monitoring systems, digital twins, and others, require knowledge to perform high-level cognitive tasks like monitoring, understanding, predicting, decision-making, and adapting. This knowledge is supplied by the ever-growing knowledge-bases in human-cyber-physical systems. To be effective, the knowledge in these bases must be human/machine-comprehensible and represented using a scalable ontology-based method. In reality, representation methods are often domain-specific and follow strict ontological formalism. Our [research team @ KIT](https://kit-amel.jp/) addresses this issue by proposing a semantic annotation-based representation method. This annotation mechanism utilizes knowledge-type-aware concept mapping, allowing for a more versatile approach. As part of our efforts, we have developed a computerized system known as the Semantically Annotated Data Visualization System (SAD-VS). This system ensures both human and machine comprehensibility of the represented knowledge.
