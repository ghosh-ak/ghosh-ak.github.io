* <b> Sensor Signal-based Digital Twins </b>
    <br><br> Digital twins (Object, Process, and Phenomenon twins) are needed for virtualizing a real-life manufacturing process and functionalizing high-level cognitive tasks (monitoring, understanding, predicting, decision-making, and adapting). Our  [research team @ KIT](https://kit-amel.jp/) is working on developing phenomena twins, using historic phenomena-relevant sensor signal datasets (e.g., cutting force, cutting torque, and alike). Two computerized systems: Digital Twin Construction System (DTCS) and Digital Twin Adaptation System (DTAS), are developed for constructing and adapting the twins, respectfully. The DTCS acquires the relevant datasets from cloud, machine learns the knowledge underlying the datasets, simulates the relevant phenomenon, and validates the simulation outcomes. On the other hand, the DTAS adapts the validated outcomes for real-time monitoring.
