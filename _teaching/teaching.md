I teach Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM), tailor-made for undergraduate students. 

As an instructor in this dynamic field, my philosophy is to equip students with the essential knowledge and practical skills to excel in CAD/CAMâ€”through hands-on projects and interactive learning. I believe the most crucial aspect for a CAD/CAM professional is unleashing creativity and mastering the art of transforming imaginative designs into tangible realities. Apart from creating lecture contents, I prepare online tutorials ([Visit YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMokYkGSWeWllinxpA-qQwg/playlists)) so that the students can follow and learn anywhere, anytime!
