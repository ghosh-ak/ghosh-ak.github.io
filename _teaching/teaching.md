<br>

I teach <b> Computer-Aided Design (CAD) </b> and <b> Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM)</b>, <br>
tailor-made for undergraduate students. 

As an instructor in this dynamic field, my philosophy is to equip students <br>
with the essential knowledge and practical skills to excel in CAD/CAMâ€”through <br>
hands-on projects and interactive learning. I believe the most crucial aspect <br>
for a CAD/CAM professional is unleashing creativity and mastering the art of <br>
transforming imaginative designs into tangible realities. Apart from creating <br>
lecture contents, I prepare online tutorials ([Visit YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMokYkGSWeWllinxpA-qQwg/playlists)) so that <br>
the students can follow and learn anywhere, anytime!
